  Return a spin lock number from the _striped_ range

  in a round robin fashion. This does not grant the caller exclusive access to the spin lock, so the caller
  must:

  -# Abide (with other callers) by the contract of only holding this spin lock briefly (and with IRQs disabled - the default via \ref spin_lock_blocking()),
  and not whilst holding other spin locks.
  -# Be OK with any contention caused by the - brief due to the above requirement - contention with other possible users of the spin lock.
